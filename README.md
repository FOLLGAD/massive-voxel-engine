My experiments with making a voxel engine.

Built on top of WebGPU.

Currently generates terrain with extensive cave systems.

## Goals

- Cool terrain features
- Highly performant â€“ can run on any consumer laptop at 60fps
- portals!!!

## Todo

### Performance

- make the worker manager use a priority queue instead of instant workers
  - cancelleable events

### Misc

- play around with different rendering styles
  - blue noise
  - pixellation
