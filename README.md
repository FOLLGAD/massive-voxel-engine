# massive-voxel-engine


My experiments with making a voxel engine.

Goals:
- Cool terrain features
- Highly performant â€“ can run on any consumer laptop at 60fps
- 

## Todo
- gpu culling + indirect drawing
- geometry batching
- play around with different rendering styles
    - blue noise
    - pixellation
